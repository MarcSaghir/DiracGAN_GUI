# DiracGAN_GUI
Implementation of the third bonus project from TU-Darmstadt course *Deep Generative Models*. The project refers to the paper "[Which Training Methods for GANs do actually Converge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406)". 

It includes:
1. **Basic Task:** Visualization of different loss functions for GANs in animated graphs, similar to the paper
2. **Additional Task:** Interactive GUI and other regularization strategies than in original paper, LeCam divergence ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03310))
